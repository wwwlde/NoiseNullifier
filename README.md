# üö´üîä NoiseNullifier

NoiseNullifier reduces alert notification noise. No more being bombarded on your chat or phone. Peace at last!

NoiseNullifier isn't about introducing complex operations or intelligence into your alert management system. Instead, it's about simplifying processes, minimizing distractions, and allowing teams to focus on resolving incidents without the constant buzz of ongoing alerts.

## Introduction

NoiseNullifier is a straightforward solution designed to streamline the response mechanism between PagerDuty and AlertManager. Upon receiving an acknowledgment event from PagerDuty via Webhook v3, NoiseNullifier initiates the process to silence the alerts associated with that incident in AlertManager.
